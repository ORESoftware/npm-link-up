 docker.r2g notes:

 this file will be copied to this location:

 $HOME/.r2g/temp/project/smoke-test.js

 and it will then be executed with:

 node smoke-test.js


 so, write a smoke test in this file, which only calls require() against your library.
 for example if your library is named "foo.bar", then the *only* require call you
 should make is to require('foo.bar'). If you make require calls to any other library
 in node_modules, then you will got non-deterministic results. require calls to core/built-in libraries are fine.
